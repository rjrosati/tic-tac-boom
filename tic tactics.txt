Ideas:
	Virus
	Better computer
	Board state evaluation, chess-esque, rule based
	Rule-based engine in emptier games
In code:
	Store differences-based megaboards for awesome memory usage
	Use bitfields to store data compactly
	When evaluating board state, only check new boards
	ITERATIVE DEEPENING and associated optimizations -- chessprogramming.wikispaces.com
		If opponent can win, assume he will -- don't pursue other paths
		Don't keep uninteresting paths in memory once known.

For app:
	play against computer
	talk to Hidden Variable, challenge them to game
	Use NDK to not code in Java
